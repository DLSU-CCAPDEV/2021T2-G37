                    The pants was very smooth and very soft. It was also very light and comfortable. This is probably my best buy ever. I am using it everyday. Planning to buy another one. great job C & S!

                    I'm on the heavy side and so wearing jeans is a struggle. But this pair let's me wear jeans again without difficulty (even though I haven't lost any weight)                </p>

                    This new version seem to fit tighter than the old version. I like it. However, this new version is mid rise, while the old version is high rise. Wouldâ€™ve been better if they made this high rise too. EZY usually meant high rise in Uniqlo lingo. Puzzled why they made this mid rise.

                    This is so comfy and stretchable, I like the fit and it is not too skinny fit on me.

                    The pants are not too skinny and indeed give a good amount of stretch. The fit is more on the slim cut side rather than on skin-hugging skinny cut. Elastic waist band is a welcome bonus.

                    Very much satisfied with my purchase. It fits me very well. Hoping for more shades of blue for this kind of ankle jeans. Thank you so much UNIQLO.                </p>

                    Great quality jeans! I got this in color blue. These are made to move pants and an all-day-every-day comfort. The material on the inside feels soft against your skin.                </p>
